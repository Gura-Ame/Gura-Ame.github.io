Mathematics frequently uses **compact notation** to represent long repetitive expressions. Two of the most common are:

- **Summation** (sigma notation): $\sum$
- **Product** (pi notation): $\prod$

This post will explain what these symbols mean, how to interpret them, and how to write them using LaTeX in Markdown.

## üî¢ Sigma Notation: Summation

The summation symbol $\sum$ represents the **sum of terms** in a sequence or function.

### Syntax

$
\sum_{i = a}^{b} f(i)
$

This means:  
**Start with $i = a$, increase $i$ by 1 until $i = b$, and sum all values of $f(i)$.**

### Example

$
\sum_{i=1}^{4} i = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
$

You can also include conditions:

$
\sum_{\substack{i=1 \\ i \text{ odd}}}^{5} i = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
$

## ‚úñÔ∏è Pi Notation: Product

The product symbol $\prod$ represents the **product of terms**.

### Syntax

$
\prod_{j = a}^{b} f(j)
$

This means:  
**Multiply all values of $f(j)$ from $j = a$ to $j = b$.**

### Example

$
\prod_{j=1}^{4} j = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 = 24
$

Just like summation, you can add conditions to exclude certain terms:

$
\prod_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \ne 2}}^{4} f_j(x)
$

This means: multiply all $f_j(x)$ from $j = 1$ to $4$, except when $j = 2$.
